# Latte With Crema

A cozy color scheme with coffee tones and pastel pink highlights. Made for personal use but published just in case it suits anybody's needs :)

This has been pretty hastily thrown together to match my linux desktop as I couldn't find something which quite fit my desires after a brief search. 
I'll update it if I encounter specific issues such as with accessibility.
